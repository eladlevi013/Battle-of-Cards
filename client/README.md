# Battle of cards
## Description
This is a simple card game. The game is played by two players. Each player has a deck of cards. The game is played in rounds. In each round, both players draw a card from the top of their deck. The player whose card has the higher value wins the round and gets both cards. If both cards have the same value, it is a tie and both players keep their cards. The game ends when one of the players runs out of cards. The player who has cards left in his deck is the winner.
